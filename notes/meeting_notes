paragraphs are good, and sidebars for regular wikipedia often have the site.

    Facebook (formerly Thefacebook) is an online social networking service headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.[7] The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students. Since 2006, anyone who is at least 13 years old is allowed to become a registered user of the website, though the age requirement may be higher depending on applicable local laws.[8] Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to it by American universities students.[9]

    The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, PBS is an independently operated non-profit organization and is the most prominent provider of television programs to public television stations in the United States, distributing series such as NOVA, Sesame Street, PBS NewsHour, Masterpiece, Nature, American Masters, Frontline and Antiques Roadshow.
    Since the mid-2000s Roper polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States.[2] However, PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations, a large proportion of which (including most specials aired during multi-annually pledge drives) come from third-party sources, including member stations (such as WGBH, WETA-TV, WNET, WTTW National Productions), American Public Television and independent producers. This distinction is a frequent source of viewer confusion.[3]
    The service has more than 350 member television stations, many owned by educational institutions or non-profit groups affiliated with a local public school district, collegiate educational institution or by state government-owned or -related entities.[4] It also operates National Datacast (NDI), a subsidiary which offers datacasting services via member stations, and provides additional revenue for PBS and its member stations.

Next Steps
==========

* Improve dictionary performance by checking where it is going wrong (something wrong with code right now)
* Use new dictionary to find common definitions that relate to privacy, entities, and site classification
* Combine with classification of site (wikipedia/conceptnet/homepage?) to check out likely information + other definitions
* Look for privacy related terms in definitions.
